Welcome from Chairs

Over the last year or so, we have been blessed with the challenge, the opportunity, and the distinct pleasure of organizing the CHI
2011 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, the premier international conference for the field of human-computer
interaction.

CHI 2011 takes place in gorgeous, energetic, sophisticated Vancouver BC, a city renowned for its innovation in entertainment,
sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity. The New York Times calls it, "a liquid city, a tomorrow city, equal parts India,
China, England, France and the Pacific Northwest." Vancouver lays a beautiful backdrop for our conference, which boasts nearly
30 years of wonderful work.

Behind the success of the conference is our diverse community of faculty and students, of researchers and practitioners, of young
and, well, also of experienced. It is a community of designers, technologists, psychologists, social scientists, biologists, artists,
engineers, anthropologists, musicians; the list goes on. Wherever we are, we are always a community of near and far. Most
impressively, ours is a community that cares deeply about innovating, learning, sharing, and interacting; all with the common goal
of using technology to shape the way people around the world live and play.

Returning attendees will recognize the general conference format - 2 days of small intimate workshops, followed by 4 days of
technical content, all surrounded by social and intellectual exchanges. In addition to the familiar venues that form the core of the
conference, we have also arranged various special events, such an keynotes by Howard Rheingold and Ethan Zuckerman; invited
talks by ACM SIGCHI award winners Terry Winograd, Larry Tesler, Alan Newell, and Clayton Lewis; an HCI museum exhibit
hosted by Bill Buxton; and a panel celebrating Stu Card's achievements and contributions to the field of HCI.

With the record number of submissions and accepted content this year, we hope that you will utilize the print and electronic
programs, but also the daily CHI Madness presentations that provide a glimpse of the day ahead. In the interest of continuing to
evolve the conference to best serve our needs, we will experiment with shorter talks this year (20 minute slots for long pieces of
content and 10 for shorter ones) to infuse even more energy into the program. We will also have a pretty full slate of social media
applications to help you connect with other attendees and to provide you with the fullest experience possible.

(Return to Top)

It has been quite the ride, and we'd like to thank everyone involved and welcome you all to the conference. We hope that CHI 2011
inspires you reflect on the past, the present, and perhaps most importantly, the future of the people and body of work that is ACM
SIGCHI. We hope you enjoy CHI 2011 in Vancouver and that you have a great time "Connecting…"

CHI 2011 Papers & Notes Co-Chairs’
Message

Welcome to CHI 2011! The Human Computer Interaction
field is continuing to grow from strength to strength and
continuing to expand and diversify. CHI is the leading
international conference in Human Computer Interaction
and it is the archival material – especially the papers and
notes – that establishes its academic credentials.  We
believe the papers and notes published here represent some
of the best current work in the field.
For CHI2011 we continued with the sub-committee
structure that was set up in 2009, with minor changes.  We
believe this is a good process for ensuring that authors and
papers are given the most expert attention, and to raise
awareness of the diverse types of good CHI papers and the
standards expected of them.
The program committee was comprised of eight topical
subcommittees. Each subcommittee comprised sub-
committee chairs and numerous associate chairs (ACs)
knowledgeable in the topic area. Authors selected the
subcommittee that they felt could best handle their
submission. We believe this has worked well to improve
the match of a submission to AC and ultimately to
reviewers, to have more focused and relevant discussions
in the program committee meeting, and to minimize the
load on individual volunteers. We combined papers and
notes to ensure a consistent decision standard across both
submission types, while also being clear about the different
requirements for a 10- versus 4-page submission. And we
used contribution types with the aim of communicating to
authors and reviewers that there are many different and
equally valid ways that a CHI submission can contribute to
the field.
This year, there were 1540 submissions that started the
review process; 1012 full papers and 514 notes were
considered at the PC meeting. In line with the growth of
the field, this is the highest number of submissions ever to
CHI. Of these, we accepted 26% - 306 papers and 103
notes.
The papers/notes committee involved 173 volunteers from
across the world: 2 co-chairs, 24 sub-committee chairs,
and 147 associate chairs (ACs). Each AC managed 10-14
submissions, and personally recruited at least three –
sometimes more – referees knowledgeable in the paper’s
topic. Refereeing was through blind review. Each referee

returned a recommendation along with a detailed review.
Authors had opportunity to rebut these reviews, allowing
them to address matters of fact, which were then taken into
account for the final decision. Additional reviews were
sometimes solicited and the majority of papers were read
by a second AC as well.  Overall, 7060 individual reviews
were produced in this process.  Committee members then
attended a two-day meeting in Maryland, USA, in
December. The committees were extremely careful in
making decisions, with many submissions receiving
multiple discussions before and during the program
committee meetings. While no review process can execute
perfectly in every case, everyone involved worked
extremely hard to ensure a fair process and to encourage
the consistency and quality of CHI reviews and the
resulting decisions across committees.
The amount of time and effort entailed in this review
process, especially for such a huge number of papers,
cannot be underestimated nor undervalued. We praise the
commitment of the sub-committee chairs, associate chairs,
and referees for their amazing hard work and their service
ethic. All gave up considerable time to this process.  The
various chairs also paid for this privilege, traveling from
all around the world to the CHI PC meeting at their own
expense.  All chairs have our gratitude and deserve the
sincere appreciation of the entire HCI community.
Finally, the paper and note selection committees
nominated 5% of the submissions for Honorable Mention,
and a top 2% nominated as Best Papers. A separate
committee then deliberated over the Best Paper
nominations to select the 1% of papers and notes to receive
a best paper award. As you will see reflected in the
program, 15 submissions were honored as best papers, and
62 were designated honorable mentions. Congratulations
to all authors who achieved this significant status!
We hope you enjoy the diverse and dynamic program
created for you by your community peers (authors, chairs
and reviewers) and that you are challenged and inspired to
move the field forward even more.

From ACM SIGCHI's President and Vice President for Conferences

SIGCHI is proud to sponsor the premier annual conference in the field of human-computer interaction. Past CHI conferences have
been known for being the stage of new developments and advances in HCI, and for memorable events. CHI 2011 is no exception.
We are extremely grateful to the CHI 2011 Conference Chair Desney Tan, to Technical Program Chairs Bo Begole and Wendy
Kellogg, and to their wonderful crew, who succeeded to build an impressive program and experience.

CHI, the conference that is organized on behalf of ACM's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) is an
ideal forum for people to meet formally as well as informally, to exchange knowledge and views, to share experiences, and to
learn. The CHI conference brings together professionals from research and practice; people from industry, academia, and from
government; long-term veterans of HCI, young professionals and students; all in an environment designed to encourage interaction.
We invite you to actively participate in that interaction: introduce yourself to people, interact with presenters and speakers, renew
old friendships and make new ones.

SIGCHI is an international community of professionals who share an interest in the many diverse facets of HCI. SIGCHI is
committed both to advancing the field of HCI, to facilitate exchange of information within the SIGCHI community, and to support
students to enter the domain.

The CHI conference is arguably the single most visible activity of SIGCHI, but we also sponsor and support a wide range of
specialized conferences in areas ranging from interactive systems design to user interface technology to computer-supported
cooperative work to "intelligent" user interfaces. Visit the SIGCHI website at http://www.sigchi.org to find our conference
schedule, listing upcoming as well as past conferences.

SIGCHI and ACM produce some of the most respected publications in the field. All members receive interactions, a highly-
acclaimed magazine covering the broad field of HCI and user interface design. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human
Interactions (ToCHI), now in its 17th year, is our flagship journal - a quarterly publication with the top-quality archival research
aimed at researchers and those translating research into practice.

(Return to Top)

SIGCHI is truly an international organization, with 32 local chapters and 3 student chapters in 19 countries on 5 continents. We
encourage all SIGCHI members to join their local chapter - or if there isn't one in your area, we would love to help you create one.
And don't forget virtual communities! SIGCHI hosts dozens of electronic mailing lists on topics ranging from HCI and the Web, to
HCI educations, to public policy and beyond. Those lists range from dozens of subscribers to thousands, and are an excellent way
to keep up with the field and with friends and colleagues.

Finally, on behalf of ACM SGICHI, we again want to thank the conference committee and all of the hundreds of volunteers who
make this conference possible. Their work makes this a rewarding experience for all of us.
