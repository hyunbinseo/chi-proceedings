We are excited to welcome you to CHI 2024!

The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference on
Human-Computer Interaction. CHI —pronounced “kai”—is a place where researchers and practitioners gather
from across the globe to discuss the latest in interactive technology. We are a multicultural community from diverse
backgrounds who together investigate new, different, and creative ways for people to interact with and through
technology.

CHI has a rich history of bringing together people from different disciplines, cultures, sectors, communities, and
backgrounds —designers, researchers, and practitioners —with the common purpose of developing, understanding,
and designing technology that works for people and society. At the same time, we increasingly realize how our
technology use has changed how we delineate work and pleasure, advancing our productivity but also threatening
our wellbeing.

Although CHI has a strong origin history in the USA, it has never been to Hawai’i and we see this rather “unusual”
location for a conference as both an acknowledgment of the role that often underrepresented regions play in the
field as well as a symbol for more outreach to the rest of the world. Furthermore, a location like Hawai’i might not
only highlight the importance of work-life balance but could also elicit new discussions on such critical perspectives
of future interactive technology.

Thanks to our massive numbers of volunteers and help from ACM and its SIGCHI members, we are excited to
present a vibrant technical and social program for you to experience. Over six days, attendees can join and continue
to engage with the CHI community, explore technology and world-class research, and engage in discussions with a
community of designers, researchers, students, and practitioners.

Ho’omaluō means “to conserve; to use or manage wisely” in the Hawaiian language. One of our goals for CHI 2024
was to make more sustainable choices wherever we can, recognizing of course that international travel especially
to locations like ours has a significant impact for many. Working with the Sustainability chairs, we have chosen
recycled, biodegradable or eco-friendly products and engaged with local suppliers wherever possible, reduced travel
related to the conference organization using videoconference meetings as much as possible, worked with the CHI
Steering and Executive Committee to identify future opportunities to reduce travel, reduced meeting times, removed
the conference bag and gifts by default and encouraged the selection of more sustainable food choices.

Furthermore, we have chosen to locate all activities in the Convention Centre and negotiated special deals with
hotels nearby to reduce the need for transportation, while the Convention Centre itself is the first and only “public
assembly, convention center” to earn LEED v.4 O+M Gold Certification in the United States.
In the spirit of
Ho’omaluō, we have also decided to set the venue’s default temperature higher to reduce air conditioner energy
usage.

A particular highlight is the Interactivity program, launched at the Reception on Monday evening, giving a live
glimpse into the future with hands-on prototypes, design experiences as well as inspirational technologies.

We are also excited to continue the commitment to making CHI, and CHI content, more widely accessible. We
provide a nursing room, childcare, all-gender bathrooms, badge pronouns, a desensitization room and a prayer
room.

We welcome you and our hope is that all attendees grow closer together as a part of the CHI community, explor-
ing technology and world-class research, and engaging in discussions with a community of designers, researchers,
students, and practitioners.

Technical Program Chairs’ Welcome

CHI 2024 is a hybrid conference running from 11th to 16th of May. The technical programme kicks off with two days
of workshops and virtual and in-person doctoral consortium on 11th and 12th of May. The conference continues with
the main technical programme on 13th to 16th of May with parallel sessions of papers, panels, journal presentations,
case studies, alt.chi, special interest groups, courses, interactivity, and the student competitions. The program also
includes SIGCHI award talks, the SIGCHI plenary panel, the SIGCHI academy panel and the SIGCHI Town Hall.

The hybrid experience is designed to make the most of synchronous in-person and asynchronous remote experiences.
Decoupling publishing of archival work from travel and in-person presentation is an important step to support more
inclusive publishing. There are many reasons why someone can’t or won’t be able to travel to CHI 2024, and we want
to send a clear message that traveling is not required for disseminating knowledge and participating in scholarly
discourse. We hope this hybrid experience gives authors meaningful ways to present and share their work, ask and
answer questions, and network and make new connections.

2024 also includes a few changes to the technical programme. We are excited to adopt ACM’s new artefact metadata
workflow, which means we are archiving research artefacts in more robust, discoverable, and reusable ways than
ever before. You’ll see “Artefact Available” badges on all the papers that participated in this new workflow. You’ll
also see new landing pages in the ACM Digital Library where the full text HTML is embedded directly in the pages
where you access articles. These new pages offer more accessible, searchable, and flexible formats for reading and
sharing content that traditionally would only be encapsulated in PDF documents.

The statistics for submissions and acceptances for this year are as follows: Papers 1058/4028 (26.3%), alt.chi 27/89
(30.3%), Case studies 48/158 (30.4%), Courses 16/27 (59.3%), In person Doctoral consortium 22/90 (24.4%),
Remote Doctoral Consortium 10/37 (27%), Interactivity 38/77 (49.4%), Late-Breaking Work 391/1154 (33.9%),
Panels 6/9 (66.7%), Workshops and Symposia 40/84 (47.6%), Special Interest Groups 13/21 (61.9%), Video Show-
case 12/37 (32.4%), Student Research Competition 12/83 (14.5%), Student Design Competition 12/70 (17.1%),
and Student Game Competition 7/28 (25%).

Our sincere gratitude goes to the conference organizing committee, the members of the program committee, review-
ers, session chairs, the SIGCHI Operations team for processing and uploading all of the talk videos and previews
across most of our content, and the CHI publications team for the production of the proceedings. We also thank
our TPC assistants for their countless hours and without whom we could not have pulled off this program.

Finally, thank you to everyone who contributed to the program – your work is highly appreciated! We hope this
year’s technical program will bring a wow factor and inspire you.

Paper Chairs’ Welcome

CHI 2024 papers track was a challenge this year, with an unprecedented number of submissions, and acceptances,
exceeding 1000 papers for the first time. CHI 2024 in Hawaii received more than 4,000 submissions, which was
much higher than 2023 (3,182 submissions) and many more than was projected at normal pre-covid growth.

This year we encouraged shorter as well as regular-size contributions by enabling authors to indicate paper length
at submission time, thus helping reviewers to treat shorter papers appropriately. As Paper Chairs, we also aimed
to improve the paper reading and reviewing experiences by reducing workload and giving more time to Associate
Chairs (ACs - senior reviewers) to do their tasks. All plans must go awry and despite having 690 ACs (an increase
from 478 in 2023), the workload still ended up being as high as previous years for many due to the overwhelming
In total across 22 subcommittees, 48 subcommittee chairs and their assistants worked
number of submissions.
with the 690 ACs and 4,176 reviewers to produce more than 15,000 reviews and meta-reviews. We recognize that
reviewing workload and fatigue in the reviewer pool remain a challenge for CHI’s future and we are extremely
thankful for the many people who were able to give their time to the process.

Of the 4,028 complete submissions, 1,651 (41%) were invited to revise and resubmit their papers and 1,626 were
resubmitted by authors (40.4%). In the second round of reviewing, through re-review and committee discussion in
the PC Meetings, 1,058 (26.3% of the original complete submissions) were finally accepted.

We hope you enjoy the exciting papers at CHI2024.
