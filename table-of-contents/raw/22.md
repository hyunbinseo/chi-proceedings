General Chairs’ Welcome

Welcome to CHI2022! This is the first fully hybrid CHI, and our return to in-person meetings after two years of a global pandemic. Our
theme has been “Cultivating Communities”, and over the past two years of planning for this conference we’ve seen how important our
communities are, and how fragile they can be. We specifically picked the term “communities” because we also understand that CHI
comprises diverse communities, and that it is a privilege for CHI to have them all come together for a few days to exchange high-level
ideas and advance the field in various directions, all aiming at a better future with technology.

Our focus for this conference has been to find ways to connect people in spite of their physical separation. It’s been to truly think about
the pros and cons of “hybrid” conferences. Our additional goal has been to think about what belonging to our communities means, and
how we can nurture that sense of belonging for all people. The conference this year is a grand experiment for us all, and while we are sure
there will be friction and problems, we are as sure that the people of CHI will overcome them, will insist on future improvements, and will
continue to drive innovation. If we decide that hybrid conferences are in our future, we’ll all need to think about new processes, new
methods of generating revenue, and new systems to support our activity.

We are proud to have pioneered a papers revision process for CHI2022. The scale of CHI has always made the revision process for
papers seem daunting, but this year with feedback from the CHI Steering Committee (which is composed of past general, technical, and
papers chairs) and some thoughtful leadership by our own papers chairs we were able to design a process by which some people could
submit papers, receive feedback, and resubmit those papers in the same cycle. For a first step, we are very happy with the results. Future
conferences will iterate on this process, and over time we will find a process that balances our desire for both speed of publication and
quality of feedback and research. But the barrier has been broken, and now CHI has a future with a revise and resubmit process.

This CHI has drawn volunteers from an open call. One of our major goals this year was to create new processes for equity and justice in
our community. We established the Equity, Justice and Accessibility roles as “executive” level positions, so those advocates could be part
of every conversation and every decision involving the conference. We conducted an open call for volunteers for almost all leadership
positions within the conference – and staffed most roles out of that open call. The only exceptions were for roles that required significant
experience or technical knowledge. Consequently, we were able to place many people into content leadership roles for the first time.

We want to be good guests in New Orleans. This is a fantastic city that has shown resilience in the face of disaster. This city is also one of
the most important cities in the country, with an amazing cross-cultural and multilingual heritage. To be good guests and support the city,
we have sourced non-profit organizations for our members to donate to, we’ve invited local artisans to sell their merchandise directly in
our exhibit hall, we’ve prioritized local, Black-owned businesses whenever possible for making purchases, and have worked closely with
our local arrangement chairs and people at the convention center to recommend experiences that will enable people to get to know the
multiple facets of this city.

We are very excited for those able to be in-person that they get to experience the Crescent City. It has been shaped by French, Spanish,
West African, and Native American cultural roots. It has also been shaped by colonialism, slavery, civil war, natural disasters, and multiple
pandemics. Through all of this, it has turned turmoil and pain into art and culture. It’s a city that is proud of itself and how it has endured.
If you get a chance to be there, check our lists of restaurants and cultural experiences. If you’re participating online, we’ll be sharing some
of our favorite content related to NOLA, including music, movies, and recipes.

The role of every CHI organizing team is to innovate to improve the conference, while also preserving what has worked in the past. We
are continuing the focus of past CHIs in considering our carbon footprint - thinking about locally sourced products at the conference,
reducing mailings and printed materials in general, buying recycled products when available. We also see the hybrid conference as a major
step towards more sustainable practices, and it enables people to advance their careers through the conference without having to make the
flight to the conference to do so.

Years of planning go into every CHI. We started this process in 2019, well before the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference operates on a
multi-year scale, which is easy to forget when one is actually attending it. For instance, when we came on in 2019, the conference city and
dates had already been selected by the Steering Committee, as contracts for spaces like convention centers often book many years ahead
of schedule. The up-side of this multi-year scale is that we continue to learn and grow - and planning this hybrid conference has taught us
many valuable lessons.

We want to thank the dozens of people who served as organizers for this conference. Given the uncertainty of hybrid, in many cases we
were asking them to organize two CHI conferences, when often organizing one is already seen as a challenge. This was a ludicrous request
to make, and these chairs all delivered spectacularly. There are too many of them to name here, but they forever have our gratitude for
their service, for their thoughtfulness, and for their passion in making CHI the best it can be.

If we’ve all learned something in the past few years, it’s that nothing is certain. At various times in our organizing process we didn’t know
what the course of the pandemic would look like. We didn’t know how people would respond to the hybrid options, or to the changes we
were making to the conference. But the other thing we’ve learned from the pandemic is to be grateful for that which endures. Like New
Orleans has endured its natural and manmade disasters, CHI will endure and thrive. This is because of you – the person willing to submit
to the conference, to review papers, to organize a venue, to advocate for others, to find reviewers, to present their work or to listen to the
work of others. In other words, our communities are what we are grateful for. Thank you and laissez les bons temps rouler!

Papers Chairs’ Welcome

Creating the papers program for CHI is a huge effort, involving so much work from so many volunteers, and often we forget to appreciate
and acknowledge this critical work in our community. Therefore, we would like to acknowledge the work of more than 600 people who
accepted the invitations and acted as sub-committee chairs (SCs), associate chairs (ACs) and assistants to the SCs who did the tremendous
work of recruiting, coordinating, and organizing reviewers for the papers program for CHI 2022. In total, the CHI 2022 papers track had 45
SCs, 466 ACs, and 2678 reviewers who read, reviewed and coordinated 2579 submissions organized into 22 split sub committees.

We hope that you appreciate the program and remember to say thank you when you meet one of the many people who took time out of
their already busy schedule to make sure that CHI 2022 has an amazing program.

Enjoy.

Technical Program Chairs’ Welcome

After 44 fully virtual events (14 courses, 29 workshops and 1 symposium) happen mid-April, the onsite-hybrid CHI 2022 conference will
kick off with a weekend packed with 18 workshops, 1 symposium, and the doctoral consortium. The main conference will run from
Monday to Thursday across more than 15 parallel sessions that will include papers, panels, journal presentations, case studies, special
interest groups, courses, alt.chi, and the popular student research, student game and student design competitions. This year, most technical
sessions are truly hybrid and will include live presentations and Q&As from both remote and onsite authors. Most pieces of technical
content also feature a pre-recorded video that will be available on the conference platform, allowing attendees to watch content and ask
questions asynchronously.

This comprehensive program is included in the Proceedings and Extended Abstracts of the conference. As with previous years, there are
two fundamental categories of contributions that go to the ACM Digital Library: Papers and Extended Abstracts. Papers are the most
rigorously peer reviewed and are considered the most prestigious material presented at the conference. The remaining categories of work
are collected in the Extended Abstracts. These include juried and curated contributions, evaluated by experts in the field, and reflect the
breadth of research, design, education, artistic, scientific exploration and engineering activity within the HCI community.

Making this program possible was a challenging and rewarding experience, involving the work of thousands of volunteers. For papers, we
received 2,579 submissions (the 2021 conference received 2,845) which were rigorously reviewed, resulting in 637 accepted papers at a
24.7% acceptance rate. At CHI this year, we will also have 258 late-breaking works from 722 submissions; 15 alt.chi from 34 submissions; 39
interactivity works from 61 submissions; 33 case studies from 96 submissions; 50 workshops/symposia from 81 submissions; 13 SIGs from
23 submissions; 10 panels from 19 submissions; and 27 courses from 28 submissions. In addition, 58 journal papers will be presented at the
conference. Finally, we will have 23 students presenting their work at the doctoral consortium from 40 submissions; 9 student research
competition works from 15 submissions; 7 student game competition works from 11 submissions; and 8 student design competition works
from 20 submissions.

The most important change this year is that the selection of CHI papers included a revise and resubmit phase to the review process. This
was organized in two rounds, giving some authors the opportunity to submit a revised version of their manuscript after having received
feedback from reviewers. The interactivity chairs also invited authors of demos that were already published in the proceedings of an ACM
conference but that had never got the chance to be presented as live, on site demos due to the pandemic. These demos are not included in
these proceedings as they do not have a new entry in the ACM Digital Library but they will run live in the New Orleans Convention
Center.

As always, we would like to warmly thank the members of the conference organizing committee, the members of the program committee
who wrote many reviews and discussed papers at length, and the abundance of external reviewers across many of the conference tracks. In
total, 11,199 reviews were written for the CHI papers track alone. We would like to thank the SIGCHI Operations team for processing and
uploading all of the talk videos and previews across most of our content. We also wish to very sincerely thank our CHI Publications team.
They have made a tremendous amount of work, and the production of these proceedings would never have been possible without them.

Finally, thanks to everyone who contributed to the program – your work is highly appreciated! We hope you enjoy the technical program
and that it inspires you!
