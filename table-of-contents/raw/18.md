We are very pleased to welcome you to CHI 2018 in Montréal, Canada! This year, the theme is Engage. Our hope is
that over the next six days, you engage with technology and world-class research, engage in discussions with your
community of designers, researchers, students, and practitioners, and—most of all—that you engage with CHI!

The engage theme informed our planning and we are excited to present a vibrant program for you to experience. In
2018, we  are  celebrating the  50th anniversary of  Doug Englebart’s Mother of all Demos. To celebrate and honour
this historic event, we are hosting the CHI Expo—a reception on Monday night that will give you the opportunity to
engage  with  the  technology  of  the  future,  as  presented  by  your  colleagues.  We  are  also  excited  to  present  the
CHI2018 Art Exhibition in association with La SAT (La Société des Arts Technologiques). Much of the virtual and
mixed-reality art can be seen in the Exhibit Hall;  however, please attend the reception  on Wednesday night  at  La
SAT  to  experience  the  impressive  Satosphere—a  360°  digital  dome  environment  with  artworks  that  explores
immersion.  This  year,  we  are  launching  the  inaugural  CHI  Game  Jam  and  Science  Jam,  where  participants  can
engage  with  mentors  and  peers  in  a  two-day  frenzy  of  activity  and  excitement.  We  are  also  bringing  back  the
plenary Video Showcase session on Wednesday afternoon.

We  are  thrilled  with  our  dynamic  keynote  speakers,  who  each  bring  unique  perspectives  to  our  theme.  Christian
Rudder  (author  of  Dataclysm)  opens  CHI  with  his  insights  on  what  data  from  the  dating  site  he  co-founded
(OkCupid) reveals about human behaviour. Sue Gardner (former executive director of Wikimedia Foundation, co-
chair of the campaign to pardon Edward Snowden) closes CHI by discussing her desire to ensure that everybody in
the world has access to the information they want and need. And Choir! Choir! Choir! leads us in a plenary session
on Tuesday afternoon on achieving creativity through shared vulnerability.

Additionally, we broadened the scope of who can engage with CHI content. We are pleased to launch the first-ever
CHI  with live-streaming of every paper session.  Live-streaming paper  presentations  allows our authors to reach a
diverse audience that includes the friends, family, and colleagues who have supported the presented research, but are
unable to attend. We support people with disabilities or travel restrictions to  remotely attend through telepresence
robots. We are offering onsite childcare that helps people with caregiving responsibilities attend CHI. We also have
several  initiatives  to  support  diversity,  inclusion,  and  accessibility  including  a  nursing  mother’s  room,  gender-
neutral  bathrooms,  badge  pronouns,  and  a  dedicated  blackout  (desensitization)  room.  Tiohtiá:ke,  (Montréal)  is
historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations, and we wish for our attendees to carry this spirit of
connection into how we engage with each other at CHI 2018.

We are so grateful to our extraordinary volunteers who made CHI 2018 possible, especially to those who organized
the venues and provided logistics support. We are greatly indebted to each of the 101 volunteers on our organizing
committee for their service in making CHI 2018 happen. Thanks also to the more than 175 student volunteers who
carry  out  on-the-ground  efforts  in  helping  CHI  to  run  smoothly.  Finally,  we  are  deeply  grateful  to  the  ACM,  to
SIGCHI, and to the CHI Steering Committee for their support of CHI 2018.

We welcome you to Montréal and encourage you to Engage with CHI!

                                                                              Regan Mandryk     &     Mark Hancock

The  CHI  2018  technical  program  consists  of  a  weekend  of  24  parallel  workshops  and  symposia  plus  additional
events such as the Game Jam, Science Jam and Doctoral Consortium. This is followed by four days that consist of
25  parallel  sessions  of  exciting  papers,  panels,  case  studies,  SIGs  (Special  Interest  Groups),  courses,  video
showcase, and the popular student research, and design competitions. The alt.chi venue, now in its fourteenth year,
presents stimulating new and challenging ideas in HCI. The Expo will showcase demos of cutting-edge technology
and the CHI Art Exhibit.

This ground-breaking work can be found in the Proceedings and Extended Abstracts, archived in the ACM Digital
Library. We distinguish between two categories of CHI material in the ACM Digital Library. Papers are the most
rigorously peer reviewed and prestigious material presented at the conference, and are collected in the Conference
Proceedings.  The  other  categories  of  work  are  represented  in  the  Extended  Abstracts.  These  are  peer-reviewed,
juried,  or  curated,  and  reflect  the  breadth  of  education,  research,  design,  artistic,  scientific  exploration  and
engineering activity within the HCI community.

Across  all  tracks,  CHI  received  3955  submissions  and  accepted  1208.  For  papers,  the  conference  received  2592
submissions  (a  rise  of  8%  from  the  2017  conference)  which  were  rigorously  reviewed,  resulting  in  666  accepted
papers (acceptance rate 25.7%). In addition 47 journal papers will be presented.

We wish to give our heartfelt thanks to the 101 members of the organising committee who kept the boat afloat and
moving  in  the  right  direction,  the  489  members  of  the  programme  committees  who  wrote  6,321 reviews,  and  the
3837  external  reviewers  who  wrote  6844  reviews.  Our  special  thanks  also  go  to  the  staff  at  Sheridan
Communications (particularly Lisa Tolles) who have worked extremely hard to ensure that all papers and extended
abstracts were processed in time for the conference.

We hope you find the technical program engaging and inspiring.

         Anna Cox       &       Mark Perry
